					<span>Started at SDE</span><i>Aug '14</i>
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'd had a taste of code and I knew that I wanted to get better at it, so I enrolled in the course 'Web-integrator' at SDE college in Odense. When I did, I didn't imagine I'd become smitten with it, but that's exactly what happened.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study is a two-year course covering HTML, CSS, responsive web design, PHP, MySQL, E-commerce, SEO and more.

					This is the first personal website I made which is still being actively maintained. The others have retired - this is the last one standing. And considering how fond of it I am, I guess I'll have to leave it be.

					<span>High School</span><i>Aug '06 - Jun '09</i>

				<p>
					I went to HF at Nakskov Gymnasium during this period of time. It was before I discovered code, so at the time I was primarily interested in science and history. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Final average score: 10,6.
