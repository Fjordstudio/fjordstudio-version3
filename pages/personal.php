		<h1>Who Am I Really (Besides a Developer?)</h1>
		<p class="featured-text">
			I am a 27-year-old Danish woman who writes (primarily poetry) under the pseudonym "K-M Skalkenæs". I also do various types of artwork - dabble in macro photography - and read when I can find the time.

					My writing
				</h2>
				<p>
					I have written poetry (seriously) since 2010, and publish my work on <a href="https://fjordscene.com">Fjordscene.com</a>. Apart from poetry, prose texts have in increasing amounts crept in over the last couple of years - leading to essays, short stories and a (so far) unfinished novel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Writing is by far my favourite form of expression - allowing me to "say" so many things I cannot get out of my mouth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The main themes of my writings are transience, interconnection vs. alienation, nature and time/changes.
				</p>
				<p>--</p>
				<p>I have also translated a bit of poetry from Swedish and Danish into English. Primarily the works of <a href="https://scandipoetry.com/poet/1" target="_blank">Edith Södergran</a> and <a href="https://scandipoetry.com/poet/2" target="_blank">Gustaf Munch-Petersen</a>.</p>

				<h2>
					My artwork
				</h2>
				<p>
					Artwork is something that I have long simply considered an extra outlet for the things I couldn't quite express in words, but still needed to say. A sort of exhaust valve for when poetry didn't quite do the trick.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, I am coming to realize that my pictorial artwork and my writing feed off each other - enhance and speak to each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a small art studio in my apartment - allowing me to work continuously on projects in calm surroundings. <br>
					Hopefully, this winter may see my first solo exhibition. Provided I can get to finish everything in time.

				<h2>
					My photography
				</h2>
				<p>
					Photography - for me - started out with the fascination that came with being able to show people how my vision works. <br>
					I am blind on one eye - so my concept of depth is entirely different from that of other people. But photography was a level playing field: A 2D plane posing as 3D. That I see exactly as everybody else.
				</p>
				<p>
					From there on it took off and led me to primarily focus on macro photography - allowing me to fuse my love and interest of science (which I was never able to translate into either study or job) with art - thereby combining disparate interests into one.
