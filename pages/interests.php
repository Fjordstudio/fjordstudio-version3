					<h1>
						Spare Time Interests
					</h1>
					<p>
						I cannot stress this point too strongly: My life does NOT revolve exclusively around code! I code out of interest, and I do so gladly while at work, but in my spare time I engage in many other creative endeavors, and it is crucial to me that I have the time to do so. Namely: writing and pictorial art. You can find some of my written works <a href="https://fjordscene.com" target="_blank">on Fjordscene, my writing blog</a> where you can also see what I'm currently planning / working on.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also read a lot; I'm well-versed in classical literature and poetry, but the occassional fantasy or sci-fi novel makes an appearance as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have worked a good deal with translating poetry from Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and German into English, as I find solace in poetry - and also because it saddened me that a good deal of modern surrealist Nordic poetry was unavailable to the world at large. See <a href="https://scandipoetry.com" target="_blank">ScandiPoetry</a>, the home of my Gustaf Munch-Petersen and Edith SÃ¶dergran translations online.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am also a rather prolific macro and nature photographer / Nikon enthusiast. See <a href="http://photography.fjordscene.com" target="_blank">my photography portfolio</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Other interests include animation, ARPG gaming (Grim Dawn and Path of Exile primarily), travelling, Star Trek, Shoegaze music, swimming and horseback riding (when I have the time).
