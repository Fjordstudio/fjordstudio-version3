				<p>
					I'd had a taste of code and I knew that I wanted to get better at it, so I enrolled in the course 'Web-integrator' at SDE college in Odense. In hindsight, an inevitable step since everything I had done was building up to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					This programme is a two-year course covering HTML, CSS, responsive web design, PHP, MySQL, E-commerce, SEO and more.

					<span>Multimediadesign</span><i>Aug '09 - Feb '10</i>
				</h2>
				<p>I started the MMD education, and quickly realized that however fun, it was a grave mistake. If I had continued, I would have ended up as a Jack-of-all-trades Master-of-none. So I quit, and did freelance work instead. And I am still convinced that I learned more by taking that route than I could've otherwise.</p>
				<p>All the same, MMD introduced me to code, and for that reason it is obviously of importance.</p>

					<span>High School</span><i>Aug '06 - Jun '09</i>

				<p>
					I went to HF at Nakskov Gymnasium during this period of time. It was before I discovered code, so at the time I was primarily interested in science and history. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Final average score: 10,6.
